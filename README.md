Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

i was tasked to update the security of the clients banking platform. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

i think pointing out vulnerable dependencies and implementing hashing is vital to the success of the companies application. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

it is challenging to properly implement new updated versions of libraries used in the program. if the library patched a fucntion that your program relies on you have to reimplement and ensure the replacement is properly implemented. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

adding the hashing algorithm and ensuring the hash is validated added some security. i would implement input validation going forward 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

i reran the dependency tools and utilized ststic testing 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

maven is very handy, ive never used it before but i can see myself using it in the future

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment

i would show the documentation i created for this classes projects
